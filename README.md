# **Python DSA Problems 🐍** 

Welcome to the Python DSA Problems repository! Here, you will find a collection of Python Data Structures and Algorithms problems ranging from beginner to advanced levels. 🚀

## **📁 Folder Structure**

The repository is structured as follows:
```
- Beginner
  - Problem1.py
  - Problem2.py
  - ...
- Intermediate
  - Problem1.py
  - Problem2.py
  - ...
- Advanced
  - Problem1.py
  - Problem2.py
  - ...
```

Each folder represents a difficulty level, and within each folder, you will find Python files for individual problems. 💡

## **🌟 How to Use**

* Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
    git clone <repository_url>
```
* Navigate to the desired difficulty level folder (beginner, intermediate, or advanced).
* Choose a problem you want to solve and open the corresponding Python file.
* Read the problem statement and implement your solution in Python.
* Test your code with different test cases and make sure it produces the expected results.
* Once you have solved the problem, you can submit your solution and move on to the next problem!
